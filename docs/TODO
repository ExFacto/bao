- Callback URLs for an event
- Add Hash-Preimage event type
- Write full testing
- Threshold Events (m-of-n sigs required)
- DONE Should Bao publish its public key and sign event points/hashes? 
    - This decreases the possibility of a MITM attack, but event hashes are deterministic, there is no way to fake an event or get a user to sign something other than the Event Hash.

- DONE centralize Hash function for easy swap
- look at switching entropy source in Utils.new_rand_int
